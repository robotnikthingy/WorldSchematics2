#Whether this schematic will be spawned naturally when new chunks are generated
enabled: true


#determines where to place the schematic. Options are:
#  ground - the schematic will spawn on the ground
#  anywhere - schematic can spawn anywhere within range of min and max 
#  air - schematic will only spawn above ground in the air
#  underground - schematic will only spawn underground
place: ground

#chance out of 10000 of the schematic spawning in a new chunk when a new chunk is created.
#for large structures its recommended to keep this low
#For something that you want to spawn frequently such as a plant, 1000.0 is recommended
#for something that you want to spawn very infrequently, similar to a village, 10.0 is recommended
#for something very rare, 1 or 0.5 is recommended.
#you may have to experiment to see what works best for you
chance: 100.0

#offsets the paste position of the schematic in the x,y,z direction when spawned.
#This can be used to adjust the schematics position.
#EX: setting y to -10 for a house with 10 block deep basement to make sure the basement is in the ground
offset:
  x: 0
  y: 0
  z: 0
